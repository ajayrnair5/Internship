        <h1>Kasaragod, </h1>
        often hailed as the 'Land of Gods', where every corner unveils a unique tapestry of culture and history waiting to be explored. Nestled at the meeting point of Kerala, Tulunadu, and Coorg, this district is adorned with a wealth of natural wonders and cultural treasures that make it a coveted destination for travellers from across the world.<br>

Culture and Natural Beauty<br>
Renowned as 'Saptha Bhasha Sangama Bhoomi',<br> here seven distinct languages are spoken reflecting its richness of traditions and influences. From ancient times, this land has been inhabited, with evidence dating back to the Great Stone Age, underscoring its deep historical roots.<br>

Situated amidst verdant hills and bordered by a coastline stretching over 30 kilometres, Kasaragod boasts some of Kerala's most pristine beaches. <br>Bekal, Kappil, and Pallikere beckon beach lovers with their golden sands and azure waters. The allure of Kasaragod extends beyond its natural splendour to its rich architectural heritage. <br>

The Valiyaparamba backwaters of Kasaragod are the ideal destination to experience the charm of the Great Backwaters of Kerala in all its glory.<br> It is the third largest backwater network in the state.  Here, time seems to slow down as the gentle waters weave their way through lush greenery, creating a symphony of tranquility.<br> For the adventurous soul, Valiyaparamba Backwaters beckon with opportunities for fishing or exploring the intricate network of waterways as well.<br>

Another highlight of Kasaragod is a serene place located on the shores of the Pallikkara village in Kasaragod, Bekal. <br>It is renowned as the home of the biggest and most well preserved fort in Kerala. The imposing Bekal Fort, built centuries ago by the Nayakas of Keladi, dominates the coastal landscape with its towering bastions and intricate pathways. It serves not only as a historical landmark but also as a vantage point for breathtaking sunsets and serene coastal vistas. <br>This is in fact only one among the numerous historical forts and structures in Kasaragod.<br>

Bekal is the first ever planned beach destination in India. <br>It has been crafted without disturbing the ecological balance or natural beauty of the region. It is believed that this was the location of an enormous palace in the past thus the name Bekal which is said to be derived from the word 'Baliakulam' which means a big palace. <br>During the times of Kolathanadu which was among the most powerful feudal kingdoms on the Malabar coast, Bekal was a vital maritime centre and port town of Tulunadu. <br>Tulunadu was the old name by which Kasaragod was known in earlier times. <br>

Today Bekal has become one of the most sought after destinations in Kasaragod owing to its picturesque beauty as well as the annual Bekal Beach Festival.<br> The ten day festival features flea markets, auto expos, flower exhibitions, sand sculpture competitions as well as exciting water sports like kayaking, parasailing, snorkeling and even helicopter rides.<br>
